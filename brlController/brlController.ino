/*BRLCONTROLLER.INO: the main file of Braille-Trainer-3's Arduino controller
To be compiled in Arduino IDE 
For debug controller use debug/main.cpp (along with CMakeLists.txt)

All definitions of classes' methods are placed in headers, not .cpp files
Reason: Arduino-specific C++ features (E. g. String, etc) are loaded only in the main .ino file*/
